### Role: Research Assistant (PI: [<span style ="color:red"> Dr.Lyndon Estes </span>](https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/facultybio.cfm?id=1110))

## Introduction

[<span style ="color:red"> Mapping Africa</span>](https://mappingafrica.io) is a project in which I played a significant role as a Research Assistant in the [<span style ="color:red">Agricultural Impacts Research Group (AIRG)</span>](https://wordpress.clarku.edu/AIRG/) at Clark University. It is pioneering an active learning approach to develop a scalable, fast, and cost-effective land cover mapping system that combines human and machine intelligence. This innovative system aims to map the distribution and characteristics of cropland in Africa with unparalleled accuracy.
