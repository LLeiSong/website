I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the University of California, Santa Barbara, working with Dr. Amy Frazier in the [<span style ="color:red">SCALE Lab</span>](https://www.frazierlab.org) on two interdisciplinary projects: [<span style ="color:red">BioFI</span>](https://bio2fi.github.io) and [<span style ="color:red">DISES ECOPLAN</span>](https://dises-ci-ucsb.github.io/dises-web/). I hold a PhD and MA in Geography from Clark University, along with an MS in Applied Meteorology and a BS in Geographic Information Science from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology.

_I’m excited to share that I’ll be joining the Department of Geography at <span style ="color:red">Rutgers University</span> as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in Fall 2025! Please feel free to reach out if you're interested in exploring PhD opportunities._

My research focuses on species conservation, human-wildlife interactions, and sustainable land use planning. I use Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Science (GIScience) to gain insights into terrestrial ecosystems, model species distributions, and assess landscape connectivity. A major goal of my work is to develop data-driven strategies that address the ecological impacts of climate change and human activities like agriculture. I also apply Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to land cover analysis and change detection, aiming to produce timely, high-resolution information for conservation and planning. 

As a landscape ecologist, my work spans diverse regions and spatial scales, but one place especially close to my heart is Tanzania, with its magnificent elephant population.
