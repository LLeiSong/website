Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at Arizona State University, where I work on the project [<span style ="color:red">Bio<sup>2</sup>FI</span>](https://bio2fi.github.io) under the guidance of Dr. Amy Frazier at the [<span style ="color:red">SCALE Lab</span>](https://www.frazierlab.org). My academic background includes a PhD and MA in Geography obtained from Clark University, along with an MS in Applied Meteorology and a BS in Geographic Information Science from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology.

My primary passion revolves around species conservation and human-wildlife relations. My expertise lies in utilizing Remote Sensing (RS) data to gain insights into terrestrial ecosystems, as well as optimizing tools for modeling species distribution and landscape connectivity. Moreover, I focus on devising strategies to alleviate the ecological consequences arising from climate change and human disturbances (e.g. agriculture). Additionally, my research delves into the domain of land cover analysis and land cover change, with a specific emphasis on employing Deep Learning (DL) models.

As a landscape ecologist, my studies encompass diverse scales and geographical regions. In particular, one study site holds a special place in my heart: Tanzania, with its magnificent elephant population.
