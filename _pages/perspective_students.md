I welcome inquiries from prospective students.

**Graduate students**: [The Department of Geography at Rutgers University](https://geography.rutgers.edu) is accepting applications for [PhD students](https://geography.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate-program/phd-program). If you are interested in working with me, I encourage you to reach out by email before the application deadline. Please include your CV along with a brief introduction that outlines your academic background, research experiences, specific interests, and why you feel I would be a good fit as your advisor.

Each year we receive far more outstanding applications than we can accommodate, given the limited availability of RA and TA positions. If you intend to apply for your own funding, I encourage you to get in touch so we can discuss possible pathways. In the U.S., opportunities for external PhD funding include programs such as the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program) and the [NASA FINNEST Fellowship](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bF9C7B701-6405-FD55-6705-EB4B190646B8%7d&path=&method=init).
